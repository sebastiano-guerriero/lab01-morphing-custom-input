# Component Tutorial Starter

This repo is the **starter project** for a YouTube tutorial that builds a UI component using:

- **HTML** (`index.html`)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (compiled locally)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (`main.js`)

You don’t need to change any setup files yourself – just follow these steps and then code along with the video.

---

## 1. Install dependencies

From this folder in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 2. Start Tailwind in watch mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This compiles Tailwind from `tailwind.css` into `styles.css` and keeps watching for changes as you follow the tutorial.

---

## 3. Open the page

Open `index.html` in your browser (for example, with a simple static server or Live Server in VS Code).
